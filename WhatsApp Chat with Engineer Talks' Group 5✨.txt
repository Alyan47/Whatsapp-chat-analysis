 *About Speaker* :
Wasiq Nadeem Khan is currently serving as a 5G Software architect at Nokia technology center Germany. He has been involved in the Research and development for telecommunication software development of real time and soft real time embedded systems since 2004. 

Wasiq completed his Bacholars in Software Engineering from College of Signals, NUST in 2001  and Masters in Computer Software Engineering from EME college NUST in 2005. During the two degrees, he was working with the College of Signals on a year contract and received Scholarship from the French government to undertake Masters in Networks and Systems from UVSQ Paris in 2004. 

Shortly afterwards, he started his tenure as Software consultant in the R&D department of Siemens communication in Germany developing 3G ngRNC software. He continued as a consultant moving from 3G to 4G and in 2010 took a permenant position with Nokia.

During the R&D tenure, Wasiq has been involved in, and lead the development of complex systems reaching MLOCs, dealing with cutting edge RAN (Radio access network) from the time of their conception, taking them through the SW product lifecycle up to maintenance and then beginning then next "G" cycle. Together with the technological development of the systems, it also required architecture, design and process orientation that can sustain the development of such complex systems across multiple sites and over decades.

In 2020, Wasiq completed his MBA from Warwick Business School (WBS), University of Warwick, U.K. His dissertation was on 5G ecosystems and its value to the CSPs.  During his MBA, he gave special focus to strategy (business and corporate), marketing and entreprenuership.
  
Wasiq has an interest in ecosystems both dealing with business and innovation systems, whether it be part of the 5G/6G domain or verticals that they aspire to sustain. He searches to find the right balance between engineering and business in order to develop an important equilibrium, especially when considering cutting edge technology and adaption.

He offers whatever he can to upcoming and eager minds, to foster them and inspire to take steps to reach their best in the fields of Wasiq's experience.

More about him can be found at his linkedIn profile found here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/wasiq-nadeem-khan.                           Feedback form will be opened during the webinar and E-certificates will only be provided to the ones filling them.

Do you wish to apply for a scholarship to study in Europe? If that's the case, an Erasmus Mundus Scholarship could be a perfect fit for you. The Erasmus Mundus Scholarship is one of Europe's most prestigious awards, and it has become a great suggestion among students.

The Erasmus Mundus initiative of the European Union seeks to improve the quality of higher education by providing scholarships and fostering academic collaboration between the EU and the rest of the world. Every year, a huge number of students apply, but only a tiny fraction of them succeed depending on the resources available to them.

Apart from that She has gained work experience in Data Science team at Teradata GDC, She has got experience with Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Data Science for healthcare.
She has already represented Pakistan in the Global Ugrad Pakistan Alumnus (Spring 2019).
 Mr. Ahmad Hassan is our second keynote speaker, He is Gold Medalist in Electrical Engineering from NUST, Selected in Erasmus Mundus Jointly Degree Program in Sustainable Transportation and Electrical Power Systems.

Both speakers will extensively guide and assist the students with their knowledge and expertise.
