[09/11/2023, 1:32:03 PM] ~ Rayyan Alam: PERSONALITY
~ The characteristics and patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that make a person unique
Comes from the Latin word persona, which refers to a theatrical mask worn by performers to disguise their true identity

Examples of thinking, feeling, and behaviours
Thinking: e.g. Optimistic vs Pessimistic
Feeling: e.g. Experience intense emotions or not
Behaving: e.g. Overtalking vs being closed up

Personality doesn't include:
- Physical and Biological Characteristics
- How people are when they are at their best
- Fleeting states like hunger, arousal or mood

Important Discussions
- Are you the same person online?
- How does social media influence our personality?
- How does our personality influence our use of social media
- What are online bullies like?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
THEORIES OF PERSONALITY

Psychoanalysis Theory (Frued)
~ According to Freud our personality is in conflict between 3 structures:
Ego, Superego, Id

Id (Reservoir of Psychic Energy)
- Works on the pleasure principle
- Source of all drives and urges
- The id seeks instant gratification
- We are all born with the id
Pleasure-based

Ego (Executive of Personality)
- Works on the reality principle
- Mediates between the id, superego and the environment
- Developed after 3 years of birth
Consequence-based

Superego (Upholder of Values and Principles)
- To do with values, morals and principles
- Often equated with the conscience
- Developed by our interactions with the world and caregivers
- Develops around age 5
Principle-based

Freud also described 3 levels of consciousness
Conscious, Sub-Conscious, Unconcious

Healthy Personality
In a healthy person, the ego is the strongest
If id is too strong it leads to selfishness
If superego is too strong it leads to being judgemental and unbending

Social Learning Theory
~ Behaviourism is the theory that people's behaviour 
is the result of the rewards and punishments they have experienced in the past
According to behaviourism, everyone has experienced different patterns of rewards and punishments
and thus developed different behaviours and personalities

Bandura's Social Learning Theory
Suggests we learn social behaviour by observing and imitating the behaviour of others
Suggest we learn from observing other people being rewarded or punished
Suggests everyone may interpret behaviour differently but on that basis learn
And that learning shapes our own behaviour and personalities 

Carl Roger's Humanistic Theory
~ Humanism is the theory that to understand a person 
is to understand how the person understands themselves (from their eyes we see them)
Roger's proposed a person-centered theory that states:
- Every person is unique
- People are inherently good and creative
- All people possess an inherent need to grow and achieve their potential
- People are free to choose their own lives and make their own decisions

Therefore for a personality to grow:
- Genuineness	being honest and open
- Acceptance of feelings and conflicts
- Empathy (being listened to and understood)
- Unconditional positive regard from the people you care most about
(especially from parents when you are young)

Concept of Self
- How someone percieves themselves
- Comprised of the real and ideal self
- When there is a large overlap of the ideal and real self then self-actualisation becomes easier

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- Human beings have needs in a hierarchal fashion 
and when one need is achieved one can transcend to another level
Physiological Needs, Safety, Love and Belonging, Self-esteem, Self-Actualisation

Trait Theory
~ The theory suggests that we all have certain distinguishable personality traits
on the basis of which we can identify and group people and adhere to that group's needs
Personality Trait
- A stable, enduring quality that a person shows in most situations
- Extremely useful for describing personality
- Can we used to measure how people differ from others

5 Factor Model
~ is a personality test based on the assumption that 
personality can be sufficiently described by 5 traits

1 Openness
+ imagination, insight, curious, broad range of interests
- practical, conventional, follows routine

2 Conscientiousness
+ thoughtfulness, good impulse control, goal-directed behaviour
- impulsive, careless, 	disorganised

3 Extraversion
+ excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, high amounts of expressiveness
- quiet, reserved, withdrawn

4 Agreeableness
+ trust, altruism, kindness, willingness to conform to group norms, affection
- critical, uncooperative, suspicious

5 Neuroticism
+ emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, irritability
- calm, even-tempered, secure

PERSONALITY HAS CONSQUENCES
Much research has been done to connect personalities with consequences
- People with certain personality traits tend to do better in academic and career life
- People with certain personality traits tend to be better at relationships



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
DEFENCE MECHANISMS
~ Unconscious psychological operation that functions to protect a person 
from anxiety-producing thoughts and feelings related to internal conflicts and outer stressors

1 Denial
- Refusal to accept reality
e.g. Not accepting doctors diagnosis of cancer

2 Displacement
- Taking out negative emotions on a less threatening target
e.g. Domestic abuse due to a toxic work environment

3 Projection
- Placing one's own unacceptable thoughts onto others
e.g. Feeling stupid but calling others stupid

4 Regression
- Returning to a previous stage of development
e.g. sitting in a corner and crying

5 Repression
- Pushing threatening or conflicting events out of conscious memory
e.g. Forgetting about the math exam in grade 12 that went horribly

6 Sublimation
- Acting out acceptable impulses in a socially acceptable way
e.g. Exercising more after a stressful workday

7 Rationalisation
- Making up acceptable excuses for unacceptable behaviour
e.g. Saying you were angry and shouted at your colleagues because you were sick yesterday

8 Humor
- Focusing on the humorous aspect of an uncomfortable or adverse situation
e.g. Making biryani jokes at a loved one's funeral

9 Suppression
- Voluntarily exclusion Pushing threatening or conflicting events from awareness
e.g. Not talking about an event and avoiding subjects related to it

[10/11/2023, 10:20:48 AM] ~ Muhammad Uzair Sabir: اہم - ہم وہ کر سکتے ہیں جو رسول اللہ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے خیبر میں کیا تھا!

 کیا آپ جنگ میں شامل ہونا چاہتے ہیں؟  مضمون کو آخر تک پڑھیں!!
 خیبر کے قلعوں میں پناہ لینے والے یہودی کھانے پینے کا سامان لے کر ہمارے نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کے جانے کے منتظر تھے۔
 خیبر کے قلعے ایک ٹھوس، اونچی جگہ پر تھے۔
 اگر آپ نے تیر مارا تو وہ آپ کے پاس واپس آجائے گا۔
 اگر تم پتھر بھی پھینکو تو وہ ان تک نہیں پہنچے گا۔
 اگر آپ چیخیں گے تو آپ کی آواز آپ تک نہیں پہنچے گی۔
 خیبر تباہ نہیں ہوا۔
 خیبر فتح نہیں ہوا تھا۔
 اسلامی فوج کئی دن انتظار کرتی رہی۔
 لیکن یہودیوں نے قلعے نہیں چھوڑے۔
 مسلمانوں کا ذخیرہ اور ان کے حوصلے ختم ہونے والے تھے۔
 وہ کئی دن انتظار کرتے رہے۔  لیکن بے سود!
 اس طویل انتظار کے بعد ہمارے نبی نے ایک حکمت عملی تیار کی۔
 کھجور کے درخت کاٹے جائیں گے۔
 خیبر کے یہودیوں کی معیشت ایک ایک کر کے منقطع ہو جائے گی۔
 ان کی قسمت ٹوٹ جائے گی۔
 ان کا مستقبل اکھڑ جائے گا۔
 کیونکہ یہودیوں کے لیے پیسہ، دولت اور خوشحالی سب کچھ تھا۔
 جیسے جیسے درخت کاٹے گئے، یہودی تباہ ہو گئے۔
 درختوں کے کٹ جانے کے بعد یہاں رہنے کا کوئی فائدہ نہیں ہوگا۔
 انہوں نے ایک معاہدہ کیا اور یہودیوں کے دارالحکومت خیبر سے اتنا سامان لے کر چلے جائیں گے جتنا وہ لے جا سکتے تھے۔
 جنگ خیبر میں شامل ہونا چاہتے ہو تو درخت بھی کاٹ دو!
 آج آپ لعنت بھیجیں گے تو بھی آپ کی آواز یہودیوں تک نہیں پہنچے گی۔
 پتھر پھینکو گے تو اسرائیل تک نہیں پہنچے گا!
 اگر آپ تیر بھی ماریں گے تو وہ تلاویو تک نہیں پہنچے گا۔
 لیکن آپ بھی ہمارے نبی کی حکمت عملی پر عمل کر سکتے ہیں!
 اپنی کلہاڑی لے لو اور یہودیوں کے درخت کاٹ دو!
 وہ کیسے؟
 ہر یہودی کی جائیداد جو آپ کے گھر میں داخل ہوتی ہے ایک درخت ہے۔
 ہر یہودی صابن جو آپ استعمال کرتے ہیں ایک درخت ہے۔
 ہر کولا جو آپ پیتے ہیں ایک درخت ہے۔
 ہر یہودی پانی جو آپ پیتے ہیں ایک درخت ہے۔
 Cokes, Pepsi, Fantas, M&S, AMC Donald's, Dominos, Pizza Huts, Tescos, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, , Ariel, Algidas, Max, Danones اور گوگل سے دیکھیں جو ان کا ساتھ دے رہے ہیں، وہ ان کے درخت ہیں۔
 کیا آپ خیبر کی جنگ میں شامل ہونا چاہتے ہیں؟
 لہٰذا بائیکاٹ کی کلہاڑی اٹھاؤ اور یہودیوں کے درخت کاٹ دو!

 ہمارا اللہ فرماتا ہے کہ جو کوئی معمولی سی نیکی بھی کرے گا اسے اس کا اجر ملے گا۔

 اس پیغام کو اپنے تمام مسلم گروپوں تک پہنچائیں۔
 آؤ مسلمانو، خیبر میں شامل ہونے کا وقت ہے۔

[25/12/2023, 10:10:39 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: It is a solution given in the notes called instruction scheduling
[25/12/2023, 10:10:42 PM] ~ ~M€HDÏ~: Lekin I4,I5 ko swap bhe karenge na matlab reschedule??
[25/12/2023, 10:11:04 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: According to risc programming, instructions can be shifted as flow is not taken in account
[25/12/2023, 10:11:12 PM] ~ ~M€HDÏ~: Kyonke I3 aur I4 me waw ke dependency arahe
[25/12/2023, 10:12:08 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: Un instructions ko mov krenge na jinke mov krne se program ka asal flow khraab na ho Jo pdf mei example hai usmein bhi ig unhii instructions ko mov kraa ha jo related nhi hai

[25/12/2023, 10:12:36 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: But it's given as a solution so technically it's right
[25/12/2023, 10:12:58 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: G phir hoga shi. I might be wrong.
[25/12/2023, 10:13:12 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Because in risc we don't actually see the flow of instructions we just see them as instructions that need to be implemented
[25/12/2023, 10:13:24 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: As it is not proper assembly language
[25/12/2023, 10:13:33 PM] ~ ~M€HDÏ~: Nae tou woh bhe sae hai na nop insert karke i4 aur i5 reschedule kardo
[25/12/2023, 10:14:33 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: Nhi RISC bhi proper assembly lang hi hai. Bs simplicity ka farq ha risc or cisc mei. Ha to dono complete assembly lang
[25/12/2023, 10:16:14 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: As far as I know, there is a solution given for data hazards where independent instructions are added in between dependent instructions, aka instruction shifting to get rid of the hazard
[25/12/2023, 10:20:19 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: Hn mei bhi yehi keh rha tha.
[25/12/2023, 10:20:22 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: Independent ko mov kr sakte hai

[25/12/2023, 10:26:05 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: We'll ignore structural hazards if encountered? In 2022 the solution is giving structural hazard
[25/12/2023, 10:28:06 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: If we encounter one in the instruction set then we will say that it is a hazard
[25/12/2023, 10:28:40 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Ideally MIPS doesn't get structural hazards from what I remember from the slides
[25/12/2023, 10:29:26 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: If you draw the solution Table after shifting of instructions you will still get WB in a same cycle. Also, there's a WAW case between And operation and Sub I think which is not corrected
[25/12/2023, 10:30:08 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: If I put Operand Forwarding instead of Scheduling, The instructions set of Question is not giving any Data Hazard btw
[25/12/2023, 10:30:20 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: For the wb in same cycle, you may add a stall
[25/12/2023, 10:30:34 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Same I did forwarding for my solution
[25/12/2023, 10:31:20 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: So we can do this as well? I don't know why solution is saying there's a Raw between SW and Sub since both are reading R1
[25/12/2023, 10:31:46 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: For the waw you may add a stall too because idk how else you would overcome that error
[25/12/2023, 10:32:39 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Maybe put that instruction later on after Sub instruction has done the WB cycle

[25/12/2023, 10:33:25 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: I think there are multiple ways to overcome the hazards, you may use whichever you think would finish all the hazards
[25/12/2023, 10:36:06 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: SW R1, 8(R9) This relation will be written like this? 8(R9) ⬅️ R1 so R1 is an input (read) rather than writing. So why is it hazard for Sub
[25/12/2023, 10:36:14 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: I didn't understand that point
[25/12/2023, 10:37:27 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Btw I just realized that I don't think there is a hazard in between SW and sub
[25/12/2023, 10:37:50 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Because you are right, r1 is read in different cycles
[25/12/2023, 10:38:33 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Lots of problems in this past paper solution
[25/12/2023, 10:38:44 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: For both instructions it's read from id stage and the stage are different so the structural hazard isn't there
[25/12/2023, 10:38:46 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Yes 😂

[25/12/2023, 10:53:04 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: My own solutions aren't foolproof but I only saw the risc programming one and I used only forwarding for that
[25/12/2023, 10:53:29 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: I think the others over here are more well-versed in this 😁
[25/12/2023, 10:53:44 PM] ~ Syed Uzair: Ok no worries just share the forwarding one since I am kinda confused how to do forwarding

Eip = 11500000

I think so
[26/12/2023, 12:10:53 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Shouldn't esp bhi 00001FF0?
[26/12/2023, 12:11:10 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Since two immediate values are pushed on the stack
[26/12/2023, 12:11:36 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: No, we have ret address too
[26/12/2023, 12:12:06 PM] ~ Syed Uzair: that is what i was thinking as we;ll
[26/12/2023, 12:12:10 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: But this esp value is after the procedure is called so the return address is already been taken care of
[26/12/2023, 12:12:37 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Besides, after the procedure is done, we still have 5 and 6 in the stack so esp is decreased by 4 twoce
[26/12/2023, 12:12:39 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Twice
[26/12/2023, 12:12:48 PM] ~ Syed Uzair: Regardless we are still pushing two immediate values
[26/12/2023, 12:13:13 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: The problem is there's an X1 offset still after ebp and it's not pop. Maybe the return address will be taken the after one

[26/12/2023, 12:14:23 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: But we also have ret 8 so the stack is cleared after the procedure

[26/12/2023, 12:16:40 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Basically it will make the stack as it was before the procedure was called
[26/12/2023, 12:16:42 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Then why are we popping ebp before that?
[26/12/2023, 12:16:44 PM] ~ Daniyal fahim: How eip is calculated?
[26/12/2023, 12:16:58 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Only the stack frame for the procedure will be cleared
[26/12/2023, 12:17:05 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Eip denote the next line address after call
[26/12/2023, 12:17:29 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: It should be ret 4 then than 8
[26/12/2023, 12:18:30 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: I don't think the pop ebp condition is used as it is used in usual stack frames over here

[26/12/2023, 12:44:11 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: so basically ret ki waja se esp jidhr starting men tha udhr hi wapis aagya after the procedure
[26/12/2023, 12:44:13 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: sahi sahi
[26/12/2023, 12:44:28 PM] ~ Syed Uzair: Yes only after the stack is cleared
[26/12/2023, 12:44:38 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Yes because esp was moved to where ebp was, aka base of the stack
[26/12/2023, 12:44:54 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: agar ret 8 ki jaga ret 4 hota ya kjhaali ret hota, tou esp ki value change hojati?
[26/12/2023, 12:45:18 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: So when the clearing was done, instead of clearing the stack frame of the procedure, it cleared 8 bits of the stack before the procedure call

[26/12/2023, 12:45:44 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Yes it would be the starting - 4
[26/12/2023, 12:45:58 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: ty
[26/12/2023, 12:46:24 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Ebp should be 1FEC initially, why it's more decrement by 4?
[26/12/2023, 12:47:08 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Idk in the debugging, it decreased it
[26/12/2023, 12:47:25 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: So I just decreased it here as well
[26/12/2023, 12:47:53 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: I think esp should be 1FF4 rather than 1FF8. Because I have seen this solution in Mid 2
[26/12/2023, 12:48:03 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: At the very end after function call
[26/12/2023, 12:49:01 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: No in the very end, it is moving esp to the base of the stack, meaning what ebp was as the procedure started
[26/12/2023, 12:49:13 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Nevertheless thanks for the debug
[26/12/2023, 12:49:25 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: So once ret 8 was done, the stack cleared 5 and 6
[26/12/2023, 12:49:38 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: And hence you have the original value as esp
[26/12/2023, 12:56:23 PM] ~ M.Rouhan: What about offset x1 and x1+4? Are they also cleared?
[26/12/2023, 1:00:33 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Yes
[26/12/2023, 1:00:40 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Because esp is moved above them
[26/12/2023, 1:01:13 PM] ~ Areeb: Pura stack clean hojata ha ig

Performance optimization technique based on the overlap of the 
execution of multiple instructions deriving from a sequential 
execution flow

Add  R1,R2,R3
1) Fetch the instruction from memory
2) instruction decode ( identify operands R2,R3 and operators addition)
3) operand fetch ( the values of operands fetch to perform the  )
4) execute perform the addition
5) write back ( store result in R1)
[26/12/2023, 8:30:37 PM] ~ <\>: B
i) A hazard is created whenever there is a 
dependence between instructions, and instructions are 
close enough that the overlap caused by pipelining would 
change the order of access to the operands involved in 
the dependence.
Example 
Sw R1, 8(R9)
Sub R4,R1, R5

ii) data hazard is between line 2 and 3
[26/12/2023, 8:31:55 PM] ~ <\>: For (iii) you can use by rearrange or adding inserting nop or stall

[10/01/2024, 5:02:19 PM] Hammad Sami: Assalamu Alaikum everyone,

We have an urgent case that requires our collective support.

A fellow FASTian is facing challenging times as their father, employed as a security guard, and their brother, who recently lost his job, are struggling to meet the financial obligations. The family is under immense pressure to cover home rent, and to further compound their situation, they have upcoming wedding expenses as the sister's wedding is scheduled for 21st January.

To assist this family in their time of need, we are reaching out for your generosity. We aim to raise 100,000 PKR to alleviate the burden of rent and contribute towards the wedding arrangements.

Your donations, no matter the amount, can make a significant impact on their lives. 
 
Please find attached the account details you can transfer the amount to. May Allah bless you with Jaza-e-Khair, Ameen.

[01/02/2024, 9:09:48 PM] Hammad Sami: Subject: Urgent Help Needed for a Needy Student, a fellow FASTian!
Assalamu Alaikum everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to you with a heavy heart on behalf of a student who is facing a dire situation.

This student is a dedicated learner, striving to build a better future for themselves. Unfortunately, they are unable to pay their fees this semester due to financial hardship. They are barely making ends meet on a daily basis.

I humbly appeal to your kindness and generosity to help ease the financial burden on this student. Every contribution, big or small, will make a significant impact on their journey towards completing their education. While we can opt for installment options and request a fee date extension for this semester, let's aim to alleviate their worries by providing the full amount at once.

Let's come together as a community to support one of our own. Your kindness will make a world of difference in their life. Please share this post and spread the word.

Thank you for your consideration and support.

Please find attached the account details you can transfer the amount to. May Allah bless you, Ameen.

[04/02/2024, 11:18:56 AM] Hammad Sami: A helpless father, who has approached for the life of his only son. Mother died recently.

Son has a problem in backbone and he cannot stand straight.

According to doctors, this needs to be operated and would require 12-13 lakh rupees. However, Indus Hospital has assured the father that they’ll operate his son for free but he’ll (father) have to bear the later expenses on his own, which are estimated to be 2-3 lakhs.

With a heavy heart, the father has asked for help for a sum of PKR 85,000.


Your donations, no matter the amount, can make a significant impact on their lives.

[09/02/2024, 6:50:15 PM] ~ hamzanaeemzafarkhan: There is a thing called "notification". The university will surely notify you through an email or the teachers will inform on GCR if there are classes scheduled for tomorrow. Btw, Thursday was an obvious holiday due to general elections, so I don't think they will compensate tomorrow, maybe the semester will get extended.

Ramadan is just around the corner, with barely 2 days left. 

We need to arrange 25-30 ration bags to be delivered by Sunday, which leaves us with only the next 2 days.

Unfortunately, we are extremely short of funds this year, and so far, we have only been able to arrange 4 ration bags.

Please contribute as much as you can. Sadqa and Zakat are applicable.

[17/03/2024, 2:57:29 PM] ~ Ayan Khan: I am organizing a Rashan drive with some friends in collaboration with Ummah Welfare Trust. We chose to work with them because they offer a door-to-door service and have excellent criteria for identifying those in need. Our objective is to distribute Rashan bags during the month of Ramadan to the less fortunate, enabling them to observe Ramadan with ease.

*We kindly request your contribution to our cause; even the smallest contribution can bring joy to numerous faces.*

[04/04/2024, 3:44:58 PM] ~ Ahmed Raza: Yeah, it asks for the following parts mentioned below. You’ll have to work on them specifically.
[04/04/2024, 3:46:19 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Okay thanks
[04/04/2024, 3:50:10 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: In kleene closure, we just write the substrings that are having a star at the top?
[04/04/2024, 3:50:26 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Or do we write the regular expression?
[04/04/2024, 3:52:08 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Could you please write the answers for these five parts if possible?
[04/04/2024, 3:52:24 PM] ~ Ahmed Raza: Isn’t Kleenes Closure supposed to be done where you write the initial state w the final state whenever final state comes in the table and then make a DFA Acc to the table?

[04/04/2024, 3:55:37 PM] ~ Ahmed Raza: Also, Acc to Kleenes Star if the initial state repeats itself, do we have to replace it w a new state? This was done in a video on YT, not sure whether teachers have used that way or not? Can anybody please confirm this method as well?
[04/04/2024, 3:57:20 PM] ~ Zain Rasool: No
[04/04/2024, 3:57:48 PM] ~ Zain Rasool: Not needed as the main structure is changing anyways so if you do it won't cause any harm.
[04/04/2024, 4:01:08 PM] ~ Ahmed Raza: Since the initial state becomes the final state as well when solving a DFA for Kleenes Star, won’t an epsilon be accepted? Whereas it shouldn’t in a Kleenes Star but it should in a Kleenes Plus (not part of syllabus ig). So in that case won’t we just introduce a new state if the initial state repeats itself?
[04/04/2024, 4:01:52 PM] ~ Ahmed Raza: Cause Acc to this question, initial state will repeat.
[04/04/2024, 4:09:32 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: initial state only repeats if it has a self loop

Mubashir Ali, a student from Shahdadpur, Sindh, has asked for assistance to continue his studies at Iobm University Karachi. Despite getting a 50% scholarship, he still needs help to pay for his tuition and other expenses.

*Mubashir comes from a rural area* where good education is hard to come by. He has been working *part-time at a medical store* to support his family while studying. *His father, who works as a daily wage laborer,* has taught him the value of education, and Mubashir is determined to break the cycle of poverty.

*Target: Rs 101,240*

*Account Details:*
- *Account Number: 03252096039*
- *Account Name: Aadarsh kumar*
-  *Platform: Nayapay*

He needs Rs. 66,240 for his first semester fee, plus Rs. 10,000 for registration and Rs. 25,000 for a security deposit, totaling Rs. 101,240. Without support, he might not be able to continue his education.

*Your donation will:*
- Help a deserving student from a low-income family
- Enable Mubashir to pursue his education and change his family's future
- Invest in the potential of a resilient and determined young person.

[04/05/2024, 8:36:20 PM] ~ Muhammad Usama: Assalamualaikum everyone,

There's a student studying Cyber at FAST NUCES, Karachi, who urgently needs our help. Due to unforeseen circumstances, her family has been facing financial difficulties for the past few years. With her father's business facing liquidation and recent losses in agriculture, they are drowning in debt.

To make matters worse, her university's last installment of 63,000 PKR is due by May 10th. Without this payment, she won't be allowed to sit for her finals. Living in a rented house with no stable income, her part-time job hardly makes ends meet for her family, which struggles to cover basic expenses like rent and groceries.

We are reaching out to our community for support during this challenging time. Even a small contribution can make a huge difference in helping her continue her education and pursue her dreams.

Your generosity can change her life. Let's come together and make a difference! Please donate whatever you can and share this message with your networks.

[18/05/2024, 9:19:17 PM] ~ Zain Rasool: No. There are classes, instead of comparing bit the classes are compared here the best possible class is 0,1 and as the page has 0,1 pari it will be replaced

[18/05/2024, 9:23:43 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Hmm.. so if all reference bits are set, we'll make it all zero and search for the 0,0 pair, if it doesn't exist we'll replace it with any 0,1 pair
[18/05/2024, 9:24:35 PM] ~ Anas Malik: Yeah the first it encounters in case (0,0) not found

[18/05/2024, 9:27:44 PM] ~ Abdul Wasey: Page B will be replaced by page E.
The modification bit (M) does not change at each pass; it only changes when a page is modified (written to). The reference bit (R), however, is typically reset to 0 at each pass or after a full cycle.

[19/05/2024, 6:54:28 PM] ~ Muhammad Ibrahim: please correct me if I am wrong I learned it from gate smashers
[19/05/2024, 6:55:25 PM] ~ Anas Malik: Whole ka 25 percent mat lo sirf page table access krne ka 25 percent lo
[19/05/2024, 6:55:41 PM] ~ Muhammad Ibrahim: Q?
[19/05/2024, 6:55:45 PM] ~ Anas Malik: Because assumption is given on the basis of page table access
[19/05/2024, 7:02:35 PM] ~ Muhammad Ibrahim: 75% of the time, the page-table entry is found in the TLB, taking zero time.
25% of the time, the page-table entry is not in the TLB, requiring two memory accesses (one for the page table and one for the actual data), each taking 200 ns.
Calculation:
Effective Memory Reference Time
=
0.75
×
200
 
ns (direct access)
+
0.25
×
400
 
ns (page table + data)
Effective Memory Reference Time=0.75×200ns (direct access)+0.25×400ns (page table + data)
Effective Memory Reference Time
=
0.75
×
200
 
ns
+
0.25
×
(
200
 
ns
+
200
 
ns
)
Effective Memory Reference Time=0.75×200ns+0.25×(200ns+200ns)
Effective Memory Reference Time
=
0.75
×
200
 
ns
+
0.25
×
400
 
ns
Effective Memory Reference Time=0.75×200ns+0.25×400ns
Effective Memory Reference Time
=
0.75
×
200
 
ns
+
0.25
×
400
 
ns
Effective Memory Reference Time=0.75×200ns+0.25×400ns
Effective Memory Reference Time
=
150
 
ns
+
100
 
ns
Effective Memory Reference Time=150ns+100ns
Effective Memory Reference Time
=
250
 
ns
Effective Memory Reference Time=250ns

So, the effective memory reference time is 250 nanoseconds.

[19/05/2024, 7:48:45 PM] ~ Amna Mubashir: Part 1 and 2 ka answer please
[19/05/2024, 7:49:59 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: I think for first it would be doubled (first checking the page table then accessing the memory) but please confirm
[19/05/2024, 7:50:43 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: part 1 400
[19/05/2024, 7:50:55 PM] Mnp10: Any idea what could be important from chapter 1, 2 & 3? Most of the important topics phley hi mids aur quizzes me evaluate ho gye hn like interrupts, system calls, fork, pipes

part 2 - > 250
[19/05/2024, 7:50:57 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: part 2

[19/05/2024, 7:51:12 PM] ~ Amna Mubashir: But why ??
[19/05/2024, 7:51:21 PM] ~ .: .75*(0+200) + .25*(200+200+0)
[19/05/2024, 7:51:21 PM] ~ Amna Mubashir: Please explain
[19/05/2024, 7:51:28 PM] ~ Naveed Raza: Easyshit
[19/05/2024, 7:51:49 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: effective memory access time = p x(Time for TLB hit)+(1−p)×(Time for TLB miss)
[19/05/2024, 7:51:58 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: I think 100 hoga 2 ka
[19/05/2024, 7:52:09 PM] ~ Muhammad Umar Orakzai: for part 2
[19/05/2024, 7:52:10 PM] ~ Amna Mubashir: And part1 why is it doubled?
[19/05/2024, 7:52:16 PM] ~ .: Yes
[19/05/2024, 7:52:36 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: kiu k 1 dafa page table ko access krega then page table se location ko

[19/05/2024, 7:52:38 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: tou double
[19/05/2024, 7:52:51 PM] ~ Amna Mubashir: Oh ok thanks
[19/05/2024, 7:52:54 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Because when you're accessing only the page table, the memory is only accessed once as the address is immediately found. But when you're not finding the desired page in the page table, you have to move to the memory that's why it is doubled
[19/05/2024, 7:53:11 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: nh
[19/05/2024, 7:53:16 PM] ~ Syed Samroze Ali: Q

[19/05/2024, 7:54:20 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: tlb ko access krne ka time 0 hai @923302935308
[19/05/2024, 7:54:33 PM] ~ Zain Abbas: should we memorize code for solution of dining philosophers problem?
[19/05/2024, 7:54:41 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: han usko tlb hit aur tlb miss men hi add krlo
[19/05/2024, 7:54:53 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Tlb is in memory it is given in the question so memory access time needs to be taken in consideration
[19/05/2024, 7:55:01 PM] ~ Muhammad Umar Orakzai: oh
[19/05/2024, 7:55:15 PM] ~ Muhammad Umar Orakzai: tlb not memory though
[19/05/2024, 7:55:25 PM] ~ Muhammad Umar Orakzai: TLB is cache which is near by

[19/05/2024, 7:55:30 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: islie 0 consider kia
[19/05/2024, 7:55:50 PM] ~ ~Shaheer: its 
0.75 x (0 + 200) + 0.25 (200 + 200)
[19/05/2024, 7:55:54 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: The total time would be the time taken to go to the memory + the time taken for tlb
[19/05/2024, 7:56:01 PM] ~ Muhammad Umar Orakzai: yes
[19/05/2024, 7:56:21 PM] ~ Muhammad Umar Orakzai: time taken for tlb = 0
memory access = 200
[19/05/2024, 7:56:25 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: But memory time toh phir bhi we have to take

[19/05/2024, 9:40:25 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: I think it's not about pointer, in FIFO you just see the oldest carrying page and replace it. It was coincidence in that frame that thing happened, because the FIFO had 3 as the oldest among 4 and 3.

[21/05/2024, 9:59:21 AM] ~ Anas Ashfaq Siddiqui: First thing to check: If Population's variance/sd given -> use Z.

Now if the let's say population variance/sd is not given it is understood that we have to use T. But there is assumption that we make, that is :
If sample size is too large we will not consider it sample instead it will behave like population so we will use it's variance/sd as if it was population's variance. So therefore replace T with Z.

[21/05/2024, 11:03:47 AM] ~ Areeb: f distribution is like t table, aage ka batata.

f>4.07 is critical region

f=5.1 aage ha so it lie in critical region hence reject h0

[25/05/2024, 2:05:41 PM] ~ Muhammad Fasih: Prerequisite – Turing Machine

Variants of Turing Machine 

1. Multiple track Turing Machine:
 A k-track Turing machine(for some k>0) has k-tracks and one R/W head that reads and writes all of them one by one.
A k-track Turing Machine can be simulated by a single track Turing machine

2. Two-way infinite Tape Turing Machine:
Infinite tape of two-way infinite tape Turing machine is unbounded in both directions left and right.
Two-way infinite tape Turing machine can be simulated by one-way infinite Turing machine(standard Turing machine).

3. Multi-tape Turing Machine:
It has multiple tapes and is controlled by a single head.
The Multi-tape Turing machine is different from k-track Turing machine but expressive power is the same.
Multi-tape Turing machine can be simulated by single-tape Turing machine.

4. Multi-tape Multi-head Turing Machine:
The multi-tape Turing machine has multiple tapes and multiple heads
Each tape is controlled by a separate head
Multi-Tape Multi-head Turing machine can be simulated by a standard Turing machine.

5. Multi-dimensional Tape Turing Machine:
It has multi-dimensional tape where the head can move in any direction that is left, right, up or down.
Multi dimensional tape Turing machine can be simulated by one-dimensional Turing machine

6. Multi-head Turing Machine:
A multi-head Turing machine contains two or more heads to read the symbols on the same tape.
In one step all the heads sense the scanned symbols and move or write independently.
Multi-head Turing machine can be simulated by a single head Turing machine.

7. Non-deterministic Turing Machine:
A non-deterministic Turing machine has a single, one-way infinite tape.
For a given state and input symbol has at least one choice to move (finite number of choices for the next move), each choice has several choices of the path that it might follow for a given input string.
A non-deterministic Turing machine is equivalent to the deterministic Turing machine.

Subject: Concern about Theory of Automata Course Coverage

Dear [Director's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my concern about the coverage of the Theory of Automata course, which is part of our curriculum. With the final exam scheduled for Tuesday, I wanted to bring to your attention that we have not been taught more than 50% of the syllabus.

As a result, I feel that we are not adequately prepared for the exam, and I believe that this may be a concern for many of my fellow students as well. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but I wanted to respectfully request your attention to this matter.

Would it be possible to discuss this further and explore options to address the gap in our learning? I would appreciate any guidance or support you can offer to ensure that we are well-prepared for the exam.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

[25/05/2024, 11:02:01 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Dekho. NPDA mei transitions more than one state per hoti. Loop Jo laga ha, uska mtlb bhale aap 'a' ke do tareqe seh read karrahe but you're only landing at one state that is q0. And b ki only one state transition hai i.e Q1. Hence it's DPDA

[26/05/2024, 3:28:18 PM] ~ MUFEED ZAIDI: aagar possible  ha bhi to
[26/05/2024, 3:28:48 PM] ~ Areeb: Wot source
[26/05/2024, 3:29:30 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Negative ke Liye 2s compliment Lena parega like in dld so ig they wouldn't give that much complexity
[26/05/2024, 3:29:38 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: If possible for negative
[26/05/2024, 3:33:19 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Why can't we just check that if there are some strings remaining on r.hs and all l.hs strings are cancelled. Can't we just state that answer is negative
[26/05/2024, 3:33:59 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: How will you state that?
[26/05/2024, 3:34:27 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: If you have to make a diagram, how will you ensure that the remaining string is after the separator?
[26/05/2024, 3:34:45 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: In unary, I think counting will always give a positive number
[26/05/2024, 3:35:01 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Just place a Z in between
[26/05/2024, 3:35:10 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Even in binary form, negative numbers are written in twos compliment form, so I don't think it will work that way
[26/05/2024, 3:35:13 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Like a barrier between two numbers
[26/05/2024, 3:35:30 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: I'm talking about unary
[26/05/2024, 3:35:46 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: But the point still stands, how will you make sure it gives a negative number
[26/05/2024, 3:35:55 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: In unary we are counting the number of ones
[26/05/2024, 3:36:02 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: And counting cannot be in negative
[26/05/2024, 3:36:19 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: So I don't think negative numbers are allowed in unary
[26/05/2024, 3:37:16 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Negativity is just a notation, you don't always have to put a - sign to show that. You can put any identification constant or variable for that. Like making a X on right N
[26/05/2024, 3:38:01 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: But still if you read the output of a unary and the answer was for eg -2, it will read it as 2
[26/05/2024, 3:38:31 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Meaning that if the operation was 2-4, it will give the answer 2 instead of -2 which is wrong
[26/05/2024, 3:38:56 PM] ~ Anas Malik: place any character which represents - before the 2
[26/05/2024, 3:39:10 PM] ~ Shariq Nadeem: Yup

[26/05/2024, 3:39:46 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Of course I could be wrong

[26/05/2024, 3:52:31 PM] ~ Ayesha Nasir: Best to use an example string to check

[01/06/2024, 11:07:33 PM] ~ Anas Ashfaq Siddiqui: To remove useless productions from the given context-free grammar (CFG), we need to identify and eliminate productions that do not contribute to deriving terminal strings. We do this in two steps: identifying non-generating symbols (symbols that do not derive any terminal string) and non-reachable symbols (symbols that cannot be reached from the start symbol).

Given CFG:
```
S → AxA | By | zC
A → B | a
B → C | b
C → SS | c | λ | ZBC
Z → aBZ | BC | Z
```

### Step 1: Identify Generating Symbols
We need to identify which non-terminals can generate terminal strings.

- **Terminal symbols** (a, b, c, y, z) are generating by definition.
- **A → a**: A is generating since it directly produces a terminal.
- **B → b**: B is generating since it directly produces a terminal.
- **C → c**: C is generating since it directly produces a terminal.
- **C → λ**: C is generating since it directly produces the empty string (λ).

Using the productions that contain only generating symbols:
- **A → B**: A is generating because B is generating.
- **B → C**: B is generating because C is generating.
- **S → zC**: S is generating because z is a terminal and C is generating.
- **C → ZBC**: C is generating because Z, B, and C are generating.
- **Z → aBZ**: Z is generating because a is terminal, B and Z are generating.
- **Z → BC**: Z is generating because B and C are generating.

Now, all non-terminals (S, A, B, C, Z) are generating.

### Step 2: Identify Reachable Symbols
We need to identify which non-terminals can be reached starting from the start symbol S.

- Start with S.
- From **S → AxA | By | zC**, we can reach A, B, C.
- From **A → B | a**, we can reach B.
- From **B → C | b**, we can reach C.
- From **C → SS | c | λ | ZBC**, we can reach S, Z, B.
- From **Z → aBZ | BC | Z**, we can reach B.

So, all non-terminals (S, A, B, C, Z) are reachable from S.

### Conclusion
Since all non-terminals are both generating and reachable, there are no useless productions in the given CFG.

Therefore, the CFG remains the same:
```
S → AxA | By | zC
A → B | a
B → C | b
C → SS | c | λ | ZBC
Z → aBZ | BC | Z
```

[13/06/2024, 8:12:22 PM] Hammad Sami: *Donation Cases*

1. Dear fellows, this case is of one of our university security guards who has been on the duty of safeguard of campus for many years now. He finds himself in a moment of dire need as his beloved daughter, who resides in their hometown of Peshawar, has fallen seriously ill and requires immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, the guard does not have the financial means to travel back to Peshawar and purchase the necessary medicines for his daughter. The total cost for his journey and medical expenses amounts to PKR 20,000. Without this support, he cannot provide the urgent care his daughter desperately needs.

2. We are reaching out to you on behalf of a sugar patient who has been referred by one of our faculty members. This individual is struggling to afford the necessary diabetic medicines, which cost him PKR 2,000 monthly. Without these medications, his health and well-being are at serious risk. Please consider making a donation to cover the cost of his medicines.

3. Similarly, there is a needy person in our community who is struggling to arrange ration for himself and his family. He is in urgent need of PKR 2,000 to meet his expenses.

4. Lastly, we have another case also referred by one of our faculty member. The individual is a teacher in a private school and will not receive pay in the month of June and July and therefore needs financial assitance amounting to PKR 10,000 inorder to meet expenses.

We humbly ask you for donation to these cases using below bank account details. May Allah reward you for your kindness. Ameen.

We are reaching out to you with an urgent appeal to assist a person, who had been working outside of their village to provide much needed financial support to his family back home. He recently suffered severe burns in a tragic accident. The doctors have advised him to take complete bed rest, which has added to the family’s financial strain. 
The family home lacks basic amenities. They do not have an electricity supply in their residence area, and their primary source of power is a solar panel. However, they urgently need an inverter and a supporting battery to make the most of this solar energy. Additionally, the scorching summer heat has made life unbearable for their bedridden son, and an air cooler is essential to ensure aid in his recovery.
Your little contribution to this case could bring comfort and hope for the boy and his family. May Allah reward you for your kind act, Ameen.
